## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TrainerGamer ~~(as I hope you would have noticed by now)~~! In my spare-time I like to code websites in HTML, CSS, JS and some times Bootstrap! I also like to dable in backend development and is something I would like to do more of in the future. 

If you want to contact me, the best way is to DM me on Discord: `TrainerGamer#0001` (due to a number of DM advertisers, my DMs are locked and I am not accepting friend requests from anyone who is not in at least one server I am also in).
